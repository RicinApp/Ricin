## Fetching the dependencies
### Ubuntu (debian based)
On ubuntu you'll need to compile ToxCore, Libsodium, and filter_audio by hand, since someone already wrote how to achieve this, please follow this guide before doing the commands beside → https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/INSTALL.md#build-manually

```bash
$ apt-get install libglib2.0-0 libglib2.0-dev libjson-glib-1.0-0 libjson-glib-dev libsoup-gnome2.4-dev libnotify-dev
```
You'll also need libconfig that is available here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/wily/+package/libconfig-dev

_Note that Ubuntu may prompt you for running this command in root. Just add `sudo` before the command and run it._

$ pacman -S meson ninja vala gtk3 toxcore glib2 json-glib libsoup libnotify libconfig
