# Introduction
**Ricin** aims to be a _secure_, _lightweight_, _hackable_ and _fully-customizable_ chat client using the awesome and open-source **ToxCore** library. We know that there are several Tox clients but this project was initially made because the other clients are still missing many features that users have been waiting for over many months. Ricin is a simple but powerful cross-platform client written in Vala and using Gtk+ 3.0.

_Screenshot might be outdated but it should give you a general idea of what Ricin is_

# Translating
Ricin uses Transifex in order to maintain Localization and enable users to help us translating it in their native language. Here's a graphic about the translations' state:

![Translations state for Ricin](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ricin/resource/ricinpot/chart/image_png)

## How to translate
In order to make a translation, please create an account on Transifex, then [go to this page](https://www.transifex.com/ricinapp/ricin/ricinpot/) and select the language you want to translate it. Transifex will redirect you to a page where you'll have to translate Ricin's strings.

**Please respect the following rules while translating:**
- Always use the same markup as the original string.
- Don't remove trailing spaces, they are needed for Ricin to display text correctly.
- Please try to translate using similar words, don't use funny words.
- Write the sentences in an imperative way.
