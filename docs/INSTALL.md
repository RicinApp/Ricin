### Debian/Ubuntu
On Ubuntu you need to compile ToxCore, Libsodium, and filter_audio by hand.
Someone already wrote on how to achieve this, simply follow the guide
to [Install ToxCore].

After ToxCore is installed, run the following line to fetch & install
the dependencies needed by Ricin to compile/run.

```bash
# Required to build Ricin:
$ apt-get install python3 valac

# Required by Ricin at runtime:
$ apt-get install gtk+3 libglib2.0-0 libglib2.0-dev \
  libjson-glib-1.0-0 libjson-glib-dev libnotify-dev \
  libsoup-gnome2.4-dev
```

>**Note**: You may have to `sudo` both lines in order to have
them running properly.

### ArchLinux
To install all the Ricin's dependencies, simply write the
following in a shell.

```bash
$ pacman -S python3 vala gtk3 toxcore \
  glib2 json-glib libsoup libnotify
```

### Fedora
On Fedora you need to compile ToxCore, Libsodium, and filter_audio by hand.
Someone already wrote on how to achieve this, simply follow the guide
to [Install ToxCore].

```bash
$ dnf install python3 valac glib2 gtk3 gtk3-devel \
  json-glib libsoup libnotify
```

## Installing Ricin

#### Others Linux
For other systems that doesn't yet have a package you have a to compile and
install Ricin from sources. Compiling Ricin is super simple as we use
**The Waf Build System** that runs pretty much everywhere.

all the Ricin's dependencies.

Run the following commands in a shell:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RicinApp/Ricin.git && cd Ricin
./waf configure --prefix=/usr/local
./waf build
sudo ./waf install
```
